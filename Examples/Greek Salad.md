# Greek Salad

A refreshing Mediterranean salad with crisp vegetables and tangy feta.

## Ingredients

- 2 large tomatoes, chopped
- 1 cucumber, sliced
- 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup kalamata olives
- 4 oz feta cheese, cubed
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tbsp red wine vinegar
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. **Chop**: Cut tomatoes into chunks. Slice cucumber into half-moons. Thinly slice red onion.
2. **Combine**: Add tomatoes, cucumber, onion, and olives to a large bowl.
3. **Dress**: Drizzle with olive oil and vinegar. Season with oregano, salt, and pepper.
4. **Top**: Add feta cubes on top. Toss gently.
5. **Serve**: Best served immediately while vegetables are crisp.

- Add bell peppers for extra crunch
- Pairs well with pita bread
